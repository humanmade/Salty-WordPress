This plugin will check your posts, comments and other content for broken links and missing images, and notify you if any are found. 

== Description ==
This plugin will monitor your blog looking for broken links and let you know if any are found.

**Features**

* Monitors links in your posts, pages, comments, the blogroll, and custom fields (optional).
* Detects links that don't work, missing images and redirects.
* Notifies you either via the Dashboard or by email.
* Makes broken links display differently in posts (optional).
* Prevents search engines from following broken links (optional).
* You can search and filter links by URL, anchor text and so on.
* Links can be edited directly from the plugin's page, without manually updating each post.
* Highly configurable.

**Basic Usage**

Once installed, the plugin will begin parsing your posts, bookmarks (AKA blogroll) and other content and looking for links. Depending on the size of your site this can take from a few minutes up to an hour or more. When parsing is complete, the plugin will start checking each link to see if it works. Again, how long this takes depends on how big your site is and how many links there are. You can monitor the progress and tweak various link checking options in *Settings -> Link Checker*.

The broken links, if any are found, will show up in a new tab of the WP admin panel - *Tools -> Broken Links*. A notification will also appear in the "Broken Link Checker" widget on the Dashboard. To save display space, you can keep the widget closed and configure it to expand automatically when problematic links are detected. E-mail notifications need to be enabled separately (in *Settings -> Link Checker*).

The "Broken Links" tab will by default display a list of broken links that have been detected so far. However, you can use the links on that page to view redirects or see a listing of all links - working or not - instead. You can also create new link filters by performing a search and clicking the "Create Custom Filter" button. For example, this can be used to create a filter that only shows comment links.

There are several actions associated with each link. They show up when you move your mouse over to one of the links listed the aforementioned tab -

* "Edit URL" lets you change the URL of that link. If the link is present in more than one place (e.g. both in a post and in the blogroll), all occurrences of that URL will be changed.
* "Unlink" removes the link but leaves the link text intact.
* "Not broken" lets you manually mark a "broken" link as working. This is useful if you know it was incorrectly detected as broken due to a network glitch or a bug. The marked link will still be checked periodically, but the plugin won't consider it broken unless it gets a new result.
* "Dismiss" hides the link from the "Broken Links" and "Redirects" views. It will still be checked as normal and get the normal link styles (e.g. a strike-through effect for broken links), but won't be reported again unless its status changes. Useful if you want to acknowledge a link as broken/redirected and just leave as it is.

You can also click on the contents of the "Status" or "Link Text" columns to get more info about the status of each link.

= 0.6.5 =

= 0.5.14 =
* Made the timeout value used when checking links user-configurable.
* The plugin will now report an error instead of failing silently when it can't create the necessary database tables.

* Cleaned up some redundant/useless code.

= 0.5.13 =
* Fixed the bug where the plugin would ignore FORCE\_ADMIN\_SSL setting and always use plain HTTP for it's forms and AJAX.

= 0.5.12 =
* Let the user set a custom temporary directory, if the default one is not accessible for some reason.

= 0.5.11 =
* Use absolute paths when loading includes. Apparently using the relative path could cause issues in some server configurations.

* Fix a stupid typo

= 0.5.10 =
* Separated the user-side functions from the admin-side code so that the plugin only loads what's required.

* Process shortcodes in URLs.

* Added an autogenerated changelog.
* Added a workaround to make this plugin compatible with the SimplePress forum.

* Fixed a bug where URLs that only differ in character case would be treated as equivalent.

* Added partial proxy support when CURL is available. Proxies will be fully supported in a later version.

= 0.5.8 =

= 0.5.7 =
* Slightly changed the dashboard widget's layout/look as per a user's request.

= 0.5.6 =
* Improved relative URL parsing. The plugin now uses the permalink as the base URL when processing posts.

= 0.5.5 =
* Minor bugfixes
* URLs with spaces (and some other special characters) are now handled better and won't get marked as "broken" all the time.
* Links that contain quote characters are parsed properly.

= 0.5.4 =
* Fixed the uninstaller not deleting DB tables.
* Other uninstallation logic fixes.

= 0.5.3 =
* Improved timeout detection/handling when using Snoopy.
* Set the max download size to 5 KB when using Snoopy.

* Removed some stale, unused code (some still remains).

= 0.5.2 =
* Fixed a SQL query that had the table prefix hard-coded as "wp\_". This would previously make the plugin detect zero links on sites that have a different table prefix.

= 0.5.1 =
* Fix a bug when the plugin creates a DB table with the wrong prefix.

= 0.5 =
* This is a near-complete rewrite with a lot of new features. 
* See �http://w-shadow.com/blog/2009/05/22/broken-link-checker-05/ for details.

= 0.4.14 =
* Fix false positives when the URL contains an #anchor

= 0.4.13 =
* (Hopefully) fix join() failure when Snoopy doesn't return any HTTP headers.

= 0.4.12 =
* *There are no release notes for this version*

= 0.4.11 =
* Set the Referer header to blog's home address when checking a link. This should help deal with some bot traps.
* I know, I know - there haven't been any major updates for a while. But there will be eventually :)
* Fix SQL error when a post is deleted.

= 0.4.10 =
* Changed required access caps for "Manage -> Broken Links" from manage\_options to edit\_ohers\_posts. This will allow editor users to access that page and it's functions.

= 0.4.9 =
* Link sorting, somewhat experimental.
* JavaScript sorting feature for the broken link list.

= 0.4.8 =
* CURL isn't required anymore. Snoopy is used when CURL isn't available.
* Post title in broken link list is now a link to the post (permalink). Consequently, removed "View" button.
* Added a "Details" link. Clicking it will show/hide more info about the reported link.
* "Unlink" and "Edit" now work for images, too. "Unlink" simply removes the image.
* Database modifications to enable the changes described above.
